# Koch Tetrahedron Fractal
## Made with <3 and GLFW

A Koch Tetrahedron fractal rendered in OpenGL.
Check out the experimental branches!!!!!

## About

This is my first 3D OpenGL project. I had an idea for a 3D fractal that I could recursively generate, and it turns out, some guy named Koch thought of it first.
The main branch is the OG Koch Tetrahedron (the lamest one) and the others are some cool variations that I found. I ended up tweaking it so much that I ended up 
with a 3d Sierpinski's triangle in one of the experimental branches, so go check those out!!

## Generating the Koch Tetrahedron:

Generated by adding a smaller tetrahedron to each triangular side of a tetrahedron, then recursively adding more to each triangular face (kinda like a 3D version
of Koch's Snowflake). Doing this more and more results in a latticed cube shape.

## Requirements

- OpenGL (development libraries)
- GLFW
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- CMake or Make (depending on your build system)

## How to Run

1. Build the project (see your build instructions or Makefile).
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./koch_tetrahedron
   ```
